Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is a branch of computer science that involves the design, development and maintenance of software applications  

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering includes the design, development and maintenance of software applications. It deffers from traditional programming in that it covers a wider scope as opposed to traditional programming which only involved the writing of code. software engineering goes beyond coding, touching on design, testing and maintainance.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. There are different phases of the software development cycle, this include 1.PLANNING: This involves defining the scope of the program and identification of the various technical approaches.
2.REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS: This icludes planning the basic project approach and creating requirement specification and getting them apprpoved. DESIGN: Here, the enigineers define the architectural modules, system structure and datab flow representation.
3.DEVELOPMENT. This entailes building the software, writing the code and intergrating components.
4.TESTING: The software built must be tested to ensure there are no bugs and that it runs and functions as intended.
5.INTERGRATION: Different moudels or designs will be intergrated into the primary source code. The information system will be intergrated into its environment and eventually installed. 6.DEPLOYMENT: Involves releasing the product to the market for use. 
7.MAINTENANCE: The software must be maintained to increase efficiency and to ensure it is up to date.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
AGILE: The Agile methodology involves a repetitive and continous approach all through the development stage.
WATERFALL: This in contrast involves a linear progressional approach that cascades downwards sequentially through the five phases of the SDLC. The waterfall methodology or module is preffered when the program has a specific, well defined end goal or purpose and all the requirements are known in advance and do mnot change. Agile on the other hand is preferred when the project doesn't have explicit constraints, timeline, or available resources or where certain details aren't known from the onset.  
Requirements Engineering: 

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
It is the process of determining, documenting and maintaining the requirements of a software system.It provides a solid foundation for the design and development phases.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a design principle aimed at creating softwares in a way that minimizes dependencies among the compmonents of a system.It makes it easier to do debugging and testing and updating of individual modules 
Testing in Software Engineering: 

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
1.UNIT TESTING: This is a test that focuses on testing individual components of a software product in isolation.
2.INTEGRATION TESTING: Is testing how different components of a software work together.
3.SYSYTEM TESTING: System testing is the process of testing an entire integrated software system to verify that it meets specified requirements and functions correctly as a whole.
4.ACCEPTANCE TESTING: Acceptance testing is the process of testing a software system to determine whether it meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery to the end-users.
Why is testing crucial in software development? 
It identifies any issues and defects with the written code so they can be fixed before the software product is delivered. 

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development?
Version conrtrol systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
1. Git: Tracks history,free and open source,supports non-linear development.,creates backups.,is scalable.,supports collaboration.,branching is easier.,distributed development.
2. CVS: Has a centralized version control,history tracking, branch and merge support, and client-server architecture.
3. Mercurial: Distributed architecture,fast,platform independent,extensible,easy to use,open Source.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager.
Software project manager's responsibilities are to analyze project constraints, establish the project objectives, coordinate the project's internal and external teams, construct the project timelines and monitor the project's key performance indicators.

What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
RESPONSIBILITES:
1.Discussing new projects and proposals with clients, colleagues and other stakeholders.
2.Planning software projects, determining scope and setting deadlines.
3.Assembling project teams and allocating roles.
4.Managing project progress to ensure projects stay on schedule.
CHALLENGES:
1.Absence of Guidance from Management.
2.Difficulty in Estimating Time & Resources.
3.Lack of Resources for the Software Development Process.
4.Defining the Requirements of the Software Projects.
5.Communication Breakdowns.
6.Under Strict Time Constraints.
7.Over-complicating the Software Development Project
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
1.Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs
2.TYPES OF MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES:Preventive maintenance – includes regular and periodic (time-based) schedules. Corrective maintenance – occurs when an issue is noticed. Predetermined maintenance – follows a factory schedule. 
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?
Ensuring the privacy and security of user data, avoiding bias in algorithms and decision-making systems, adhering to intellectual property rights, promoting diversity and inclusion in software development, and being transparent about the potential impacts of their work on society and the environment. 
How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work
Actively engaging in conversations about ethical considerations, prioritizing accountability and risk assessment, and advocating for diversity and inclusion
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
